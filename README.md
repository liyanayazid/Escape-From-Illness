1. Rules

The player must roam around the room to search for question boards. Once they read and
understand the question, they must search for the correct answer box. There are many correct and
wrong answer boxes scattered across the room. In order to pass the question, the player must take
the correct answer box and place it at the question board. There is a virus enemy that will chase
the player around the room. The player must avoid touching the virus or their health point will be
reduced. Besides that, there are also traps placed in the room. If the player stepped on the trap, it
will explode and cause their health point to be reduced. There is also bonus health item which the
player can obtain at certain places in the room. Their health will instantly recover once they pick
up that item. Once the player’s health reaches zero, the game will be over. After the player manage
to place the correct answer boxes to the question boards, the door will automatically open and the
player will be able to escape from the room.
